  <li>Intelligent Trip Planner: (BE Project)</li>
  <p>This designed website will help the users for effective utilization of time between two transportation facilities considering the time constraint. 
This website will also provide the necessary directions for the travelers. 
The basic requirement to avail these features is just completing the registering process and then logging in into the account as per necessity.</p>
  <li>Short Text Classification Of BBC News:</li>
<p>For easier understanding of users, classifying the dataset of BBC news. Classifying manually the data into the different category is easy only when 
the dataset is very short but it is very clumsy or tricky to classify a large number of data set manually so for that use algorithms for classification of short text. 
This is proposed to classify the BBC news which is having multiclass and multi labels.</p>
  <li>Migration of Traditional Network Through Automation: (M.Tech Project)</li>
<p>Validation of each and every step of order manually is tedious and time consuming. For validation of each order has
TAT (Turn Around Time) of 2 days and to achieve TAT more man power is must needed. To overcome this, design an Automation tool 
ehich is automativally validates the order.</p>
